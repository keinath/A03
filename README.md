GitHub Tutorial

Overview:
There are 3 components we will be discussing; Webstorm, Git and Github:
WebStorm is a powerful and intelligent IDE that gives you the best coding assistance for JavaScript, HTML and CSS and a wide range of modern web technologies.
Git is a revision control system, a tool to manage your source code history. 
GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories, a repository is a web hosting facility that stores data, files, various digital projects and code, typically for webpages.
  i.e.) Git is the tool, GitHub is the service for projects that use Git.

Installation:
In order to successfully complete a project, you must download all three programs on to your device. The areas to signup and download can be found on the respective sites. 

Synch:
Using the same account/email to sign up to all three applications is key. Because each application is a component of the whole project,using the same account allows synching, transfering, and uploading files. Depending on the version of the applications/software, after signing in, go to "System Preferences" and check to make sure that the accounts are linked together. 

Features:
Cloning - any repository created on GitHub is considered a remote repository, so cloning means to copy the repository and save it on to a local drive
Remote - stored on a code hosting service like Github, or any internal server
Commit - save, save changes,
Push - upload from local repository (your local drive) to remote repository (Github)
Pull - upload/update from remote repository to local
Fetch - downloads files, commits, from remote to local
Branch - displays and allows developer to access previous commits
Merge - allows you to integrate the lines from git branch into a single line branch
Merge conflict - occurs when merges have competing commits
